  "body": " 1 Systems of Linear Equations (ILA 1.1, 1.2)     This worksheet is a bit shorter than most other worksheets to give time to discuss course and studio organization. We will discuss:   A) What are studios? How are they different from lectures?   B) How do TAs support your class?   C) Studio recordings and worksheet solutions.   D) How students can ask questions during studio.   E) Office hours (please attend them!).   F) General advice on how to succeed in linear algebra (and college!).      A is a set of linear equations. An example of a linear system with two equations is    We might want to know:   what values of the unknowns satisfy all equations in the system, if any?  what procedure do we want to use to identify those values?

How can we determine whether a linear system is consistent?       What are the three row operations that we can use to reduce a matrix?       What does it mean for a system to have a unique solution?       What does it mean for two matrices to be row equivalent?          Indicate whether the statements are true or false.     If a linear system has more equations than unknowns, then the system cannot have a unique solution.      If a linear system has more unknowns than equations, then the system could have an infinite number of solutions, or the system could have no solutions.     Before moving on - what strategies does your TA(s) recommend that students can use to approach true\/false questions?      For what values of A and B, if any, does the system have (a) an infinite number of solutions? (b) no solutions? (c) exactly one solution?      For the case where there are an infinite number of solutions, sketch the set of solutions. Note that sketches need to have labeled axes. The set of solutions should be a line that does not have arrows.       Consider the line .     Sketch any two points on the line. In this class we will always put x1 on the horizontal axis.      Sketch the line.      Construct a linear system of equations so that the line is the solution set. Use at least two equations. How many equations could you have in your system?      If the point is any point in the solution set, is the point also in the solution set for any real number k?      "
