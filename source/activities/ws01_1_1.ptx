        This worksheet is a bit shorter than most other worksheets to give time to discuss course and studio
organization. We will discuss:</p>

        <m>{\large \textbf{1.2 Linear Systems}}</m> 
        <p>A <m>{\textbf{linear system}}</m> is a set of linear equations. An example of a linear system with two equations is</p>
        <me>x + 3y = 4</me>
        <me>5x + 6y = 5</me>
        <p>We might want to know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>what values of the unknowns satisfy all equations in the system, if any?</li>
          <li>what procedure do we want to use to identify those values?</li>

               If a linear system has more equations than unknowns, then the system cannot have a
unique solution.

infinite number of solutions, or the system could have no solutions.

         For what values of A and B, if any, does the system have (a) an infinite number of solutions?

    <p>For the case where there are an infinite number of solutions, sketch the set of solutions. Note
that sketches need to have labeled axes. The set of solutions should be a line that does not
have arrows.</p>
